## Functions

Functions are a very important part of programming languages to run. Functions in programming languages are based on the core concept of functions in mathematics. A function is an operation that takes certain values \(referred to as arguments\) as input, and returns a single value as an output.

$$k = f(x,y)$$

In the above statement, _**k**_ is the returned value, from the function _**f**_ that takes _**x  **and _**y  **as arguments. We could have had defined `f(x,y)` as follows -

$$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$$ 

This would imply that for values 3 and 4 of **x **and **y** respectively, **k ** would be 25.
