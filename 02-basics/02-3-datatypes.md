## 2.3 Datatypes

Computers store data in binary format - i.e. `0`s and `1`s.  
That is grouped into bytes.

Humans on the other hand, do not understand bytes or binary directly. We  
understand numbers like 1, 20, 42 \(which are whole numbers\), or 23.4, 10/4,  
\(which are decimals or fractions\). We understand letters of the alphabet like  
`A` or `g`, and words formed by these alphabets like `nyan` and `cat`.

Fortunately, most programming platforms, allow us to use datatypes more human-readable  
than plain bits and bytes.

Some common data formats computer programming languages support are -

| Data type | Description | Examples |
| --- | :--- | ---: |
| integer | whole numbers | -1, 0, 15 |
| float | decimal numbers or rational  fractions | -2.5, 0.1, 22.3334 |
| character | a single literal. could be a letter  or a number or a symbol | 'a', 'B', '4', '/' |
| string | a sequence of characters | 'word', 'o em gee' |
| boolean | a 2-value data that can be  truthy or falsy | true, false |
| array | an iterative sequence.  each item of an array could be any  of the above data types | \[1,2,3\], \['a', 'e', 'i'\] |

### 2.3.2 Datatypes in Javascript

In Javascript we have following datatypes -

| Data Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **number** | Any numerical value. Does not distinguish between whole numbers and fractions | 1  |
|  |  |  |
