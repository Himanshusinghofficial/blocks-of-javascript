## 2.2 Variables

The concept of variables is primary to most programming languages. There are hardly any high language that does not deal with variables. This is so because, variables are an important concept of algebra.

Consider the following  mathematical equations -

```math
x + y = 5;
x - y = 1;
```

Trivially we can see that **x** and **y** might be **3** and **2**, but if we had to formally solve this, we can proceed so forth. 

```math
x + y = 5, and x - y = 1;
=> (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1
=> 2x = 6
=> x = 3

Now using the resolved value of x,
   3 + y = 5
=> y = 2
```

During the entire process, what you possibly realised is that, what **x** really is, is a container / wrapper for the integer **3.**

In computer programming, variables work similarly.
