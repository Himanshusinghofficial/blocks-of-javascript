Either using a Javascript REPL (REPL stands for read-eval-print loop, which means a 'shell' or 'console' like interface where you can write code line by line, and the interpreter interprets each line before you move to the next), or by writing a .js script file, and running it.\n1.1.1 In a browser\nOriginally, Javascript was a browser-only language. And all web browsers support executing Javascript. You have two options -\nREPL\nOpen the console of your browser. The shortcut would be the following - \n\n\n\nBrowser\nWindows / Linux\nMac OS\n\n\n\n\nFirefox\nCtrl + Shift + K\nCmd + Shift + K\n\n\nChrome\nCtrl + Shift + J\nCmd + Opt + J\n\n\n\nRunning a script\nIn a folder save two files - index.html and script.js\nIn the index.html file, write the following code - \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen write your Javascript code in the script.js file, and then open the index.html   file in a browser. Open the Web console if you want to see the output of your code. \n1.1.2 Without a browser (NodeJS)\nWe can also use Node.JS to run Javascript directly on a computer without having to use a Browser. Once Nodejs is installed we can do one of the following\nREPL\nJust enter the following command in your terminal \nnode\n\nAnd that would bring to you the NodeJS REPL.\nRunning a script\nRunning a script with Nodejs is straight forward. Save your Javascript code in a script.js file, and then, from the same folder, in a terminal run - \nnode server.js\n\n"},"01-getting-started/01-2-input-and-output.html":{"url":"01-getting-started/01-2-input-and-output.html","title":"1.2 Input and Output","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Input and Output\nTo start learning a computer language, the first thing to understand is how to take input and give output. Because without output, you have no proof the program running, and hence no idea of how exactly the code that you are writing runs.\n1.2.1 Output from a Javascript Program\nThere are many ways for the Javascript program to give an output. The easiest one is to just print back into the console from where the script/interpreter is running.\nSimple type this line and see what happens -\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\nAnother way is to generate a visible alert for the user. (This is something that works only in Browsers).\nwindow.alert(\"Something happened\");\n\n1.2.2 Taking input from user\nTaking input from the user in the browser is possible through prompts.\nwindow.prompt(\"Enter Something\");\n\nWhatever you'll type into the prompt dialog, get's printed on the console.\n\n\n"},"02-basics/intro.html":{"url":"02-basics/intro.html","title":"2.

And for that, we must know what the building blocks of that language are.\nDrawing an analogy from a literary language (English) and a programming language (Javascript), we can say the following -\n\n\n\nEnglish\nJavascript\n\n\n\n\nStory\nSoftware/App\n\n\nChapter\nProgram/Script\n\n\nParagraph\nFunction\n\n\nSentence\nStatement\n\n\nWord\nToken\n\n\nAlphabet\nCharacter\n\n\n\nGoing up the chain, let's see what these are -\nCharacter\nThese are letters (A-Z,a-z), numbers (0-9), and special characters like !@#$%^&*(), and others. Every language will have a valid set of characters which can be used to write code. Some languages support using letters of foreign languages too. For Javascript, the Unicode charater set is supported, with with various rules and reservations about which characters can or can not be used in different situations. \nToken\nA token is a single meaningful unit of code. There are tokens like var which is a keyword for declaring variables, tokens like a simple number 10 which represents the integer 10. Symbols like + - * / = are also tokens \nStatement\nA statement is a single unit of code that makes sense on its own. Similar to what a sentence is in literary languages, when you put tokens together into a line of code, which can be interpreted by the interpreter and some logical step gets taken, that piece of code is called a statement. Some examples are - \nvar a = 10 which sets that value of a  to 10. \nconsole.log('hello')which prints the word hello to the screen. \nFunction\nA collection of statements, that will execute in a given order (governed by some logic). A process of starting the execution of the statements within a function is called invoking, though, more colloquially, calling a function is correct.\n"},"02-basics/02-1-common-syntax.html":{"url":"02-basics/02-1-common-syntax.html","title":"2.1 Common Syntax","keywords":"","body":"2.1 Basic Syntax\nJavascript is interpreted line by line. Each line written is read and the interpreter 'executes' the line before moving on to read the next line. The meaning of a line to the Javascript interpreter is not the same as what a line means to a text editor. A \"line of code\" could be more or less than a \"line of text\".  Lines can be optionally terminated with ;(semicolon) in Javascript.\nThe following, although written in one line, is technically two lines for the interpreter.\nvar a = 10; window.alert(a);\n\nSimilarly the following declaration of function, although takes 3 lines, will be just a single line when the interpreter goes through it for the first time\nfunction myFun () {\n    window.alert('hello')\n}\n\n2.1.1 Comments\nComments are lines in your code that are ignored by the interpreter. Lines that start with // are considered as single line comment.\nvar a = 10;\n// This is a comment\nvar str = 'this is not a comment';\n\nThere are also multi-line comments, started with /* and ended with */Anything encountered between these two symbols are ignored by the interpreter.\nvar num = 10;\n/* \nWe begin a comment\nAnd it continues\nvar k = 20\nk wasn't actually declared, because we are in a comment\n*/\nvar str = 'this is not a comment';\n\n"},"02-basics/02-2-variables.html":{"url":"02-basics/02-2-variables.html","title":"2.2 Variables","keywords":"","body":"2.2 Variables\nThe concept of variables is primary to most programming languages. There are hardly any high language that does not deal with variables. This is so because, variables are an important concept of algebra.\nConsider the following  mathematical equations - \nx+y=5\nx−y=1\nTrivially we can see that x and y might be 3 and 2, but if we had to formally solve this, we can proceed so forth.\n (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1 \\\\\n&=> 2x = 6 \\\\\n&=> x = 3\n\\end{aligned}\n\">x+y=5; x−y=1=>(x+y)+(x−y)=5+1=>2x=6=>x=3\nNow using the resolved value of x,\n   3 + y = 5\n=> y = 2\nDuring the entire process, what you possibly realised is that, what x really is, is a container / wrapper for the integer 3.\nIn computer programming, variables work similarly.\n2.2.1 Declaring and Using Variables\nThe way to declare and store data in variables, and use them is as follows -\nvar a = 10;\nvar b = 11;\nvar c = b - a;\nconsole.log(c); // Output: 1\n\nNOTE the usage of the operator = here. It works as 'assignment' operator in Javascript (and most other programming langauges). var a = 10 means, in english - \"Let the value of a be 10\", and not the statement \"The variable a is equal to 10\"\n\n2.2.1.1 Mutability\nThe mutability of a variable says whether we can change the value of a  variable once it has been declared. There are 3 variable declaration keywords - var, let and const\nAnd this how var and let work.\nvar a = 10;\na = 12; //value can be changed\nlet b = 20;\nb = 0; // value can be changed\n\nIt may appear to not be any different, but var and let have different scopes (we are soon going to cover that).\nAnd this is how const works -\nconst k = 123;\nk = 0; // Error: Because we cannot change value of const.\n\n2.2.2 References\nWhen we create a variable, we have a LHS (Left Hand Side) and a RHS (Right Hand Side). The LHS is the name of the variable, and the RHS is the data contained in the variable. (In computer science, those are technically called l-value and r-value in fact).\nWhenever we write something like myVar = 10, we are reassigning the LHS to point to a new RHS.\nIn Javascript the assignment statements are value-copy and not reference-copy type.   \nvar a = 10;\nvar b = a;\nb++;\nconsole.log(b); // 11\nconsole.log(a); // 10 (not 11)\n\nIn line no. 2 in the snippet above, b = a, here's what happens : -\n\nInterpreter looks at RHS. Finds a\nInterpreter finds out the value of a (i.e. 10)\nInterpreter assigns this value to the LHS, which is b\nNow b contains the value 10, and a contains the value 10\nAt this point, after execution of this line, there is no relationship between b and a anymore.\n\nThis behaviour holds true only for variables that have data like number, string or boolean. For other data types like objects and arrays, assignments are reference-copy, and not value-copy. We will see this later\n\n"},"02-basics/02-3-datatypes.html":{"url":"02-basics/02-3-datatypes.html","title":"2.3 Datatypes","keywords":"","body":"2.3 Datatypes\nComputers store data in binary format - i.e. 0s and 1s.That is grouped into bytes.\nHumans on the other hand, do not understand bytes or binary directly. Weunderstand numbers like 1, 20, 42 (which are whole numbers), or 23.4, 10/4,(which are decimals or fractions). We understand letters of the alphabet likeA or g, and words formed by these alphabets like nyan and cat.\nFortunately, most programming platforms, allow us to use datatypes more human-readablethan plain bits and bytes.\nSome common data formats computer programming languages support are -\n\n\n\nData type\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\ninteger\nwhole numbers\n-1, 0, 15\n\n\nfloat\ndecimal numbers or rational  fractions\n-2.5, 0.1, 22.3334\n\n\ncharacter\na single literal. could be a letter  or a number or a symbol\n'a', 'B', '4', '/'\n\n\nstring\na sequence of characters\n'word', 'o em gee'\n\n\nboolean\na 2-value data that can be  truthy or falsy\ntrue, false\n\n\narray\nan iterative sequence.  each item of an array could be any  of the above data types\n[1,2,3], ['a', 'e', 'i']\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Datatypes in Javascript\nIn Javascript we have following datatypes -\n\n\n\nData Type\nDescription\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nnumber\nAny numerical value. Does not distinguish between whole numbers and fractions\n1, 43.22, -0.5\n\n\nstring\nAny array of characters, (JS by default supports UTF-8 charset, so all characters of a string must in UTF-8). There is no character datatype, so single characters are also strings\n\"hello\", \"a\", \"wow !\", \"this is str 2\"\n\n\nboolean\nA value which is either true or false\ntrue, false\n\n\nundefined\nA special datatype in Javascript for 'undefined' data. An undefined type basically means there is no data in it. It is similar (but not exactly same) to 'void' datatype in C-like programming languages\nundefined\n\n\nfunction\nIn Javascript functions themselves are first-class objects. So a function is also a variable. The type of such variables which are functions is function\nfunction a () {return \"a\"}\n\n\nobject\nPretty much everything that can be classified into any of the above datatypes, is an object. All types extend from the object type in Javascript. Arrays and null are also of the type object\n{a: 10, b:20},   [1,3,4]\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Finding Datatype of object in Javscript\nWe can find the data type of an object in Javascript using the  typeof operator.\nvar a = 10, \n    b = 'str', \n    c = [3,4,1], \n    d = {P:1, Q:2}, \n    e = null, \n    f = false,\n    g = function () { return 0} ;\n\nconsole.log(typeof a) // \"number\"\nconsole.log(typeof b) // \"string\"\nconsole.log(typeof c) // \"object\"\nconsole.log(typeof d) // \"object\"\nconsole.log(typeof e) // \"object\"\nconsole.log(typeof f) // \"boolean\"\nconsole.log(typeof g) // \"function\"\nconsole.log(typeof undefined) // \"undefined\"\n\n2.3.2.2 Type \"strictness\" in Javascript\nWhile data has type in Javascript, the variables do not enforce types strictly. Which makes Javascript a loosely typed language. \nWhat this essentially means is that unlike languages like C/C++ or Java, where writing int a = 10 makes a an integer variable, and in future you cannot write something like a = false to assign a boolean to it , in Javascript, doing something similar is perfectly valid. \nvar a = 10;\nconsole.log(typeof a) //\"number\"\na = \"hello there\"\nconsole.log(typeof a) //\"string\"\n\nNOTE that values always have types. 10 is number. 'hello' is string. Being loosely typed means the variable (i.e. the LHS) has no type strictly defined. That is a container 'a' which contained the value 10, can at some point of time in future contain the value 'hello'. Thus, the container 'a' does not constrain itself from containing any type of data.\n\n"},"02-basics/02-4-equality.html":{"url":"02-basics/02-4-equality.html","title":"2.4 Equality","keywords":"","body":"2.4 Equality\nLike other programming languages, Javascript supports a simple and easy way to check if two variables contain the same data.We use the == operator to check if the LHS and the RHS are equal to each other. The output of the equality check is either true  or false  \nvar a = 10;\nvar x = 10;\nconsole.log(a == x) // true\nvar p = 20;\nconsole.log(p == x) // false\n\n2.4.1 Strict and non-strict equality\nJavascript can check for equality using == as well as === operator. The difference between the two is that the double-equals operator does a non-strict equality check. If the LHS or the RHS, can be cast to a different data type that is equal to the other side, the == operator would still return true. Whereas, the === operator will check for the LHS and the RHS to be of the same datatype and having the same value.\n10 == '10'  // true\n10 === '10' // false\n\n"},"02-basics/02-5-functions.html":{"url":"02-basics/02-5-functions.html","title":"2.5 Functions","keywords":"","body":"2.5 Functions\nFunctions are a very important part of programming languages to run. Functions in programming languages are based on the core concept of functions in mathematics. A function is an operation that takes certain values (referred to as arguments) as input, and returns a single value as an output.\nk=f(x,y)\nIn the above statement, k is the returned value, from the function f that takes x  and y  as arguments. We could have had defined f(x,y) as follows -\nf(x,y)=x2+y2\nThis would imply that for values 3 and 4 of x and y respectively, k  would be 25.\nA similar result can be achieved in Javascript using the following syntax:\nfunction f (x,y) {\n    return x*x + y*y\n}\n\nvar k = f(3,4)\n\nconsole.log(k) // 25\n\nThe syntax to define a function is like this function funName (arg1, arg2) { /* body */ }\n2.5.1 Function return types\nIn many languages, functions must have a strictly defined return type. Since Javascript is loosely typed, and we cannot enforce types on variables, thus functions do not have a return type. Which leads us to write code like this -\nfunction add (a, b) {\n    return a + b\n}\n\nvar p = add(1,2)\nvar q = add('hello', 'world')\n\nconsole.log(p) // 3\nconsole.log(q) // \"helloworld\")\n\n"},"03-strings/intro.html":{"url":"03-strings/intro.html","title":"3.

It splits the string\ninto an array of strings at every occurence of the given regexp. The regexp can just be simple string,\nor it can use full RegExp powers to split a string at each 'sh' or 's' as shown below\nlet str = \"she sells sea shells on the sea shore\"\nstr.split('a')\n//['she sells se', 'shells on the se', 'shore']\nstr.split(' ')\n//[she,sells,sea,shells,on,the,sea,shore]\nstr.split('')\n//[s,h,e, ,s,e,l,l,s, ,s,e,a, ,s,h,e,l,l,s, ,o,n, ,t,h,e, ,s,e,a, ,s,h,o,r,e]\nstr.split(/[ sh, s]/)\n//[,,e,,ell,,,ea,,,ell,,on,t,e,,ea,,,ore]\n\nAs seen, we can split a string with '', i.e. an empty string which basically turns the string\ninto an array of its individual characters.\n"}}}
